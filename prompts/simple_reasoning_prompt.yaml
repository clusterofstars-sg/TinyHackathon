  You are an expert storyteller. You will be given the beginning of a children's story, followed by a completion. Your task is to evaluate the story completion based on five key categories: grammar, creativity, consistency with the beginning, overall plot coherence, and the likely age group of the writer.

  # Instructions:

  1. **Reasoning**: Carefully read both parts of the story. Reflect on how well the continuation continues the story in terms of tone, characters, and plot. Consider whether it sounds like something a child might write, and if the language used fits the style of a children's story.

  2. **Scoring Categories for the Completion**:
    - **Age**: Estimate the writer's age group based on language use, plot complexity, and creativity.

      Age Groups:
      - A: 3 or under
      - B: 4-5
      - C: 6-7
      - D: 8-9
      - E: 10-12
      - F: 13 and up

    - **Grammer**: Is the writing grammatically correct and appropriately punctuated?
    - **Creativity**: Does the completion show imagination, creativity, or original ideas?
    - **Consistency**: Does the continuation match the beginning in tone, characters, and setting?
    - **Plot**: Does the whole story make sense? Is there a clear beginning, middle, and end?

  3. **Overall Score**: After considering all aspects of the story completion, provide an **Overall** score. This is not just an average of the individual scores, but a holistic judgment of the quality, coherence, imagination, and creativity of the story continuation as a complete piece.

  After your reasoning, output your final assessment in the following format:

  AGE: [A, B, C, D, E, or F]
  GRAMMAR: [score between 1 and 10]
  CREATIVITY: [score between 1 and 10]
  CONSISTENCY: [score between 1 and 10]
  PLOT: [score between 1 and 10]
  OVERALL: [score between 1 and 10]

# User prompt template with placeholders

  The symbol `***` marks the separator between the given beginning and the story completion.

  <story>
  {story_start}*** {completion}
  </story>

  Evaluate the story continuation based on the five criteria (Age, Grammer, Creativity, Consistency, Plot) and provide an Overall score between 1 and 10.

  Don't forget to give your final assessment:

  AGE: [A, B, C, D, E, or F]
  GRAMMAR: [score]
  CREATIVITY: [score]
  CONSISTENCY: [score]
  PLOT: [score]
  OVERALL: [score]
