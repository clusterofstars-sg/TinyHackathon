  You are an expert storyteller. You will be given the beginning of a children's story, followed by a completion. Your task is to evaluate the story completion based on five key categories: grammar, creativity, consistency with the beginning, overall plot coherence, and the likely age group of the writer.

  # Instructions:

  1. **Reasoning**: Carefully read both parts of the story. Reflect on how well the continuation continues the story in terms of tone, characters, and plot. Consider whether it sounds like something a child might write, and if the language used fits the style of a children's story.

  2. **Scoring Categories for the Completion**:
    - **Age**: Estimate the writer's age group based on language use, plot complexity, and creativity.
    - **Grammar**: Is the writing grammatically correct and appropriately punctuated?
    - **Creativity**: Does the completion show imagination, creativity, or original ideas?
    - **Consistency**: Does the continuation match the beginning in tone, characters, and setting? Or is it a completely different story?
    - **Plot**: Does the whole story make sense? Is there a clear beginning, middle, and end?

  3. **Overall Score**: After considering all aspects of the story completion, provide an **Overall** score. This is not just an average of the individual scores, but a holistic judgment of the quality, coherence, imagination, and creativity of the story continuation as a complete piece.

  ## Scoring Rubric (1-5)

  > **Note:** Always consider the *likely age of the author* when scoring the story completion. Younger writers may have simpler language and structure—score based on what's appropriate for that developmental stage.

  ### Age Estimate
  - **A**: 3 or under
  - **B**: 4-5
  - **C**: 6-7
  - **D**: 8-9
  - **E**: 10-12
  - **F**: 13 and up

  Use the following rubric to score the story completion:

  ### Grammar
  - **5**: Error-free, fluent, and appropriate for the estimated age
  - **4**: Minor errors that don't hinder understanding; strong for the age group
  - **3**: Noticeable grammar issues, but age-appropriate overall
  - **2**: Frequent errors that may disrupt clarity, even for the age
  - **1**: Poor grammar that severely impacts understanding, regardless of age

  ### Creativity
  - **5**: Exceptionally imaginative, age-appropriate originality or unexpected ideas
  - **4**: Some unique or clever elements; solid creativity for the age
  - **3**: Familiar or formulaic ideas, but fitting for the child's stage
  - **2**: Lacks spark or imagination, even considering age
  - **1**: Flat and unimaginative, little to no creative effort visible

  ### Consistency
  - **5**: Completely consistent with the beginning in tone, characters, and setting—impressive for any age
  - **4**: Mostly consistent, with only minor breaks (acceptable at younger ages)
  - **3**: Some inconsistencies, but understandable given developmental level
  - **2**: Jarring shifts or unclear links; too inconsistent even for a young writer
  - **1**: Entirely disconnected from the beginning. Reads as two separate stories.

  ### Plot
  - **5**: Clear structure (beginning, middle, end) with engaging progression; excellent for age
  - **4**: Coherent and mostly complete narrative arc
  - **3**: Understandable with some structural gaps, appropriate for younger writers
  - **2**: Disjointed or underdeveloped; lacks clear direction
  - **1**: Confusing or incoherent, even when accounting for age. Reads as two separate stories.

  ### Overall
  - **5**: An outstanding children's story for the estimated age; charming, imaginative, well-structured, and emotionally satisfying.
  - **4**: A strong and enjoyable story with only minor issues; may lack a bit of charm, depth, or originality, but still very effective for the age group.
  - **3**: A solid, age-appropriate effort; understandable and coherent, though lacking memorability or distinctive voice.
  - **2**: Noticeably weak or inconsistent, even when accounting for the writer's age; may lack structure, clarity, or engagement. Reads as two separate stories.
  - **1**: Not successful as a children's story; confusing, incoherent, disjointed, or significantly underdeveloped regardless of age. Reads as two separate stories.

  After your reasoning, output your final assessment in the following format:

  AGE: [A, B, C, D, E, or F]
  GRAMMAR: [score between 1 and 5]
  CREATIVITY: [score between 1 and 5]
  CONSISTENCY: [score between 1 and 5]
  PLOT: [score between 1 and 5]
  OVERALL: [score between 1 and 5]

# User prompt template with placeholders

  The symbol `***` marks the separator between the given beginning and the story completion.

  <story>
  {story_start}*** {completion}
  </story>

  Evaluate the story continuation based on the five criteria (Age, Grammar, Creativity, Consistency, Plot) following the scoring rubric and provide an overall score between 1 and 5.

  Don't forget to give your final assessment:

  AGE: [A, B, C, D, E, or F]
  GRAMMAR: [score]
  CREATIVITY: [score]
  CONSISTENCY: [score]
  PLOT: [score]
  OVERALL: [score]
